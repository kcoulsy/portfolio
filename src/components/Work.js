//       <h3>Lottery Online Game</h3>
//       <p>This web app project was for a module at University. It required us to create a website that functions similar to a normal lottery. I built this in ASP.net as was required, however we had to use Visual Basic and so the backend isnt very clean. Using ASP.net was not a great experience, everything felt outdated and there were a lack of resources for every problem I came accross. I did however get 81% mark for this work.</p>

//       <h3>Expense Manager</h3>
//       <p>This project follows Andrew Meads course on Udemy. It features React with Redux, and integration with Firebase. This gave me a good grounding to start working on my own projects.</p>

//       <h3>Indecision</h3>
//       <p>This is my first App created in React. For this I followed Andrew Meads React course on Udemy. I really enjoyed this one, and learnt more about styling including a bit of SCSS. While I mearly followed along the tutorials, for this I feel I got a good grouding in React.</p>

//       <h3>Twitch API</h3>
//       <p>A challenge from the Front End section on FreeCodeCamp. First time checking out APIs and learnt a lot from it. Throwing in some simple Javascript to add a bit of interaction for the user. The design looks horrible, but I was going for functionality in this project.</p>

//       <h3>Wikipedia Search</h3>
//       <p>Another Challenge from FreeCodeCamps Front End section. This one was to take a search and show the resulting Wikipedia pages. I did even less design on this project as I wanted to move onto more interesting things.</p>

//       <h3>Bookmarking App</h3>
//       <p>A simple app: add a website the bookmarrk list. It stores it in localstorage, and validates the URL is valid. Not much to this one, just improving Javascript skills.</p>
