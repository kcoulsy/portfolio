I built this in ASP.net as was required, however we had to use Visual Basic and so the backend isn\'t very clean. Using ASP.net was not a great experience, everything felt outdated and there were a lack of resources for every problem I came across. I did however get 81% mark for this work.',

There are more details on my GitHub Repo for this project. Something to note is that 1and1 is a horrible host for this project. I could not edit the apache settings which is a big part of this project. This prevents Update and Delete responses from working and there are URL issues. Works perfect locally.',
